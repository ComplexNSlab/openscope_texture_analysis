# openscope_texture_analysis
Code used to analyze the data from the openscope textures project (behavior and imaging)

ChangeLog
### Sept 18
- Added matlab code to produce single session analysis: see `behaviorSingleSessionAnalysis.m`. It will use the licks/stim/rewards files to plot the session behavior and generate the histograms of first lick vs isChange trials and surrogates
